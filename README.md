# Dash: Virus Phylogenetic Tree Application

This is a demo of the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code.

To learn more check out our [documentation](https://plot.ly/dash).

## Introduction

ðŸ‘‰ [Explore the app on Dash Gallery](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-phylogeny/).

### [Technique/field associated with the instrument]

This Dash app was inspired by the excellent [Nextstrain project](https://nextstrain.org/zika?dmin=2014-06-17).

## Requirements
- The Python version required is >= 3 to control this app;
- The list of all packages is listed in requirements file (see requirements.txt);
- The commands to run that will set up this app and get it ready to run : >python3.6 app.py

## How to use the app
The command needed to run the app:
python3.6 app.py

In the [online app](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-phylogeny/), you can select a virus, and the evolution of the virus as a phylogeny tree will display with a map and time series of the virus's global spread.
